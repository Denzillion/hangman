# Hangman Game Implementation

Hangman is a classic word guessing game. In this implementation, the computer selects a word and the player attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## How the Game Works

The computer randomly selects a word from a predetermined list. The player has a certain number of attempts to guess the word correctly. For each attempt, the player guesses a letter in the word. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed; otherwise, the player loses an attempt.
